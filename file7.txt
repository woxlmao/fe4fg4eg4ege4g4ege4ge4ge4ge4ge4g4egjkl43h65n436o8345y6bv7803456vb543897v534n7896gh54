There are nights when even the stars whisper to me, asking who I fight for, who I burn for, who I live for. And I smile, because I know the answer is sealed in my heart, untouchable by any force in this world. You — the one who carries the kind of light that even shadows bow before.
I imagine us in a battlefield of life, chaos roaring around, but when my eyes catch yours, everything turns silent. The storm can rage, swords can clash, but in that instant, I am only a man who has found his reason to never fall. You are not just someone I love — you are the armor that shields me, the fire that pushes me forward, the home that waits beyond every war.
Sometimes I think… if the world ever asked me who I truly am, I wouldn’t answer with my name. I would answer with yours. Because every part of me has slowly been sculpted by the thought of you, every vein filled with the promise I made to protect your smile. Even my mistakes, even my scars — they are proof that I have lived as a man who dared to love you with everything he had.
And if destiny ever dared to test us, it would find me standing unbroken, sword in one hand, your hand in the other. Because love like ours doesn’t crumble, it doesn’t fade — it only grows sharper, brighter, more dangerous to anything that tries to break it.
You are my secret legend, my eternal oath. The one the world will never fully understand — but I do. And that is enough to keep me breathing, fighting, and winning.
