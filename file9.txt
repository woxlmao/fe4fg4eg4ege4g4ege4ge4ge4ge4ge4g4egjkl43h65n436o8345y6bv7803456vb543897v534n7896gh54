Day Unknown, Year Eternal

This morning, I woke with her name echoing in my chest. Not just as a thought, but as a pulse, a rhythm that refuses to die down. I wrote it down in the margins of this diary, not once, not twice, but until the ink began to blur, as if even the pen knew her presence is infinite.

Afternoon, Somewhere Between Battle and Breath
The world tried again to drag me into its noise. Distractions, doubts, temptations — they came like soldiers charging at me. But I remembered her laugh, the way it bends the air around it, and suddenly my armor felt heavier, my grip stronger. Every distraction broke apart against the wall of her memory. Today I won, because she was my strategy and my shield.

Evening, As the Sun Fell
The sky turned the same colors as her aura — fiery orange, soft pink, fading purple. I watched it and wondered: how does she do it? How does she paint herself into everything I see? Even silence feels shaped by her. Even shadows bend into her outline. I wrote another line here: She is not just part of my time — she is time itself.

Night, Where Dreams Begin
Before sleep came, I imagined us years from now. Older, stronger, yet still reckless in our love. I pictured a house, not grand, not royal — but warm, filled with her presence. Her voice in the next room, her hand finding mine even in sleep. And in this diary, on that night, I’ll still be writing the same truth I write today:
The world can measure me by days, months, or decades — but my true calendar begins and ends with her.
